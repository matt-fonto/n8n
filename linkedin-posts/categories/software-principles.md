How I Went from Junior to Senior Frontend Developer – Lessons, Challenges & Mindset Shifts

Looking back at my journey from a Junior to a Senior Frontend Developer, I see three key factors that made the biggest impact: mindset, problem-solving approach, and collaboration skills. Here’s what I’ve learned along the way:

🚀 From Task-Doer to Problem-Solver
As a junior, I focused on writing code that worked. As I grew, I started asking why before jumping into how. Understanding the business needs behind a feature helped me make better architectural decisions and prioritize effectively.

⚡ Owning the Bigger Picture
Early on, I optimized for individual tasks. Later, I realized the importance of system design, performance, and scalability. Thinking beyond the code—how users interact, how teams maintain it, and how it scales—made me a more valuable developer.

🤝 Collaboration Over Solo Performance
At first, I thought being a great dev meant writing the best code alone. But real growth happened when I started mentoring juniors, discussing trade-offs with designers, and aligning with backend engineers. Strong communication and teamwork unlock real impact.

🔥 Continuous Learning & Adaptability
Tech evolves fast. What made me effective was not just learning new frameworks but developing a structured approach to learning itself. Reading RFCs, understanding design patterns, and embracing feedback accelerated my growth.

This transition wasn’t just about writing better code—it was about shifting how I think, communicate, and solve problems.

I wanted to say this in my last post too but figured it deserved its own spotlight.

Let’s talk stacks and the pressure developers feel to know everything.
React, Gatsby, Next, Nuxt, PHP, Go, Python, Flutter, MySQL, MongoDB, MSSQL, PostgreSQL, Docker, Firebase, Redis, and the list keeps growing…

At some point, you’ve got to ask:
Are we building developers…. or expecting encyclopedias?

Sure, after years in the field, we all pick up tricks. We understand patterns. We can "figure it out" when needed.
But let’s be clear:

- Gatsby works beautifully for static sites.
- Next.js shines in eCommerce and SEO-heavy platforms.
- React is ideal for SPAs.
- Python has its strengths in data and scripting.
- Go is a beast for speed and concurrency.
- PHP still powers a chunk of the web (yes, really).
- Every tool has a purpose. Every stack has a place.

Not every developer needs to know every one of them — and that’s okay.
Some devs go deep instead of wide. That’s specialization, and it's a strength not a limitation.

Hiring a React dev for your app team? Makes sense.
Hiring a Next.js expert for your eCommerce division? 100% valid.
Need someone to clean up your WordPress backend? Please don’t send them a MERN-stack job post.

It’s like expecting your luxury car mechanic to also fix motorcycles, forklifts, and commercial trucks just because they “work with engines.” ⚙️

Full-stack devs carry a lot. Like a general manager, they understand how everything connects. That holistic view is powerful, especially for MVPs, team leads, or technical planning roles.

But most senior devs don’t become full-stack overnight.
They grow into it by:

- Working across front-end and back-end
- Touching infrastructure
- Building, breaking, fixing, and refining.....for years!

What we often call "full-stack" is actually:

- A senior backend dev who knows how to structure front-end work.
- A senior frontend dev who understands how to integrate APIs and databases.
- Someone who can lead projects, not just write code.

So to every developer out there feeling unsure:
Pick a path. Master it. Then expand your borders.

That’s how you grow. That’s how you stand out. No one needs to be a unicorn.
Just be damn good at what you do and stay curious.

2025: “AI will replace software engineers.”
2008: “Autogeneration will replace software engineers.”

Yeah… still waiting. 👀

Back in 2008, Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin) dropped Clean Code and pushed back on the idea that UML diagrams + CASE tools would make devs obsolete.

The narrative was the same:
👉 Human developers obsolete.
👉 Just describe what you want, let machine build it.

Fast-forward 17 years:
We’re still writing code.
Only now, we’ve got smarter tools — like LLMs.

✅ Less boilerplate
✅ Smarter autocomplete
✅ Less “how do I sort an array in JavaScript” Googling

We evolve.
We adopt better tools.
We solve harder problems.

💡 Developers aren’t being replaced.
We’re being augmented.

So no — we’re not going anywhere.
In fact, we’re just getting started.

Prove me wrong. I’ll wait. 🕰️🤔

Why Full-Stack Developers Matter and Why Specialists Still Have Their Place
I see a lot of discussions about whether developers should be full-stack, front-end, back-end, or something in between.

Here’s my take, based on real-world experience:
Full-stack development is powerful.
It lets you see the whole picture, front-end, back-end, infrastructure, and that's critical when you're building MVPs or new products.

But once you move past MVP stage, reality sets in:
No one can master everything perfectly. At some point, you need specialists. If my frontend is built in React, I want a strong React developer not someone still learning it after switching from another framework.
If my backend is Node.js, I want someone confident working in that ecosystem not fumbling through backend logic.

When I hire, I’m looking for depth where it matters most because every delay costs time, money, and momentum. And honestly? Full-stack developers actually make great product managers and project managers.
Why?
Because they understand the bigger picture across the stack — not just one slice of it.

They can anticipate issues, bridge gaps, and keep everything moving.
But specialists cannot be replaced.

Think about it:
You wouldn’t ask your accountant to handle sales, marketing, and operations too. You hire an accountant because you want your accounts handled professionally.

If I need someone for the debtors department, I’m not hiring a CA.
I'm hiring someone specialized in debtors.
If I need a React front-end built properly, I want a React developer — not someone "learning it on the fly."

Titles aren’t the problem.

- Full-stack
- Backend
- Frontend
- DevOps
- Product Manager
- PHP Devloper
- React Developer
  You name it....

Every title represents a set of skills and expertise that, at the right time, is essential.

Let’s not make the industry messy by getting upset about "titles."
Good teams and great products happen when you respect what each professional brings to the table.

And let’s be real:
A full-stack dev (and I say this as a full-stack dev myself, leaning heavily toward backend) won’t build a large production system faster than a well-structured, specialized team.

It’s not about doing it all.
It’s about doing it right.

"Stupid" questions are often the most important ones

At some point in your career, you stop pretending you know everything — and start asking the questions you avoided before.

The shift happened for me when I joined a project with a mature codebase and a lot of moving parts. Everyone around me seemed to “just get it.” I didn’t. At first, I kept silent. Didn’t want to sound junior. Didn’t want to interrupt.
Eventually I asked something like: “Why are we passing this flag all the way down when it’s only used once?”
Turns out… no one really knew.
We had just been doing it that way for months.

That one “stupid” question led to a chain of simplifications — and a few quiet “yeah, I’ve been wondering that too.”

𝗠𝘆 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀
• “Stupid” questions often reveal assumptions the team stopped noticing.
• Creating an atmosphere where people feel safe to ask them is leadership.
• You can be the most senior dev in the room — and still ask “wait, what does this acronym actually mean?”

I’ve since made it a habit to welcome dumb questions — from others and from myself. Because when they don’t get asked, we end up building on misunderstandings.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘁 “𝗼𝗯𝘃𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀” 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗱 𝘂𝗽 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗯𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗯𝘃𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹?
Let’s normalize asking. It helps everyone.

3 Lessons I Wish I Learned Earlier in My IT Career

1️⃣ You’re not just building features — you’re building systems.
Completing a task isn’t just about making it work today; it’s about ensuring it doesn’t hinder the team tomorrow. Think in terms of scalability, maintainability, and clarity.

2️⃣ State management is more complex than it appears.
Many bugs stem not from logic errors but from how and when state is accessed or modified. Whether using Redux, MobX, or Context API, understanding data flow is crucial.

3️⃣ Polished UI is about trust, not just aesthetics.
A responsive, accessible, and intuitive interface communicates that the team cares about the user experience. It’s less about flashy designs and more about reliability and empathy.

These insights took time and experience to internalize. I’m still learning every day.

What lessons have you learned in your IT journey that you’d share with others?

How to break into IT? Remember the cliché phrase “forget what you were taught in university”? Programming is like a craft — you need a master who will pass on their experience, and a real-world project to work on.

You can endlessly practice creating chess games, simulating a library, or sorting books, tic-tac-toe, and calendars. That’s why the main goal for breaking into IT is to get your first offer as early as possible, where you can gain real-world experience, rather than just studying the basics of programming before landing your first job. At some point, your brain will get overwhelmed with new knowledge, and without practice, it’s hard to keep that jumble of information in your head.
