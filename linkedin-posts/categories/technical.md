🔐 Authorization in React

Authorization isn't just about hiding buttons or protecting routes, it's about safeguarding your data.

The most critical place to enforce authorization is at the API layer. That's the first barrier where read/write access is checked before your database is even touched.

In small apps, this often happens in your data-fetching functions or server actions. This is where you check:

🧍 "Is the user authenticated?"
🔍 "Are they allowed to do this?"

As your app grows, your architecture does too. You’ll start separating responsibilities across:

✅ API Layer – Quickly blocks unauthorized requests
✅ Service Layer – Business logic, roles, permissions, and ownership checks
✅ Data Access Layer – Final safety net before touching the database

Each layer builds on the last, creating a secure flow that defends your data from misuse or unauthorized access.

💡 Bonus tip: Use caching to avoid repeated session lookups per request, and redirect unauthenticated users before rendering protected pages, for both security and better UX.

🙅‍♂️ What about hiding UI elements like "Delete" buttons?

Yes, but it's solely for user experience, not security. Malicious users can still poke around.

🎯 The golden rule: Your app is only as secure as your backend authorization.

TypeScript has become the go-to language for large-scale JavaScript applications. But have you ever wondered how TypeScript code turns into JavaScript? Let's dive into the compilation process, explore its stages, and understand why TypeScript makes JavaScript development better. 🚀

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗧𝘆𝗽𝗲𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗗𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗴?
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning it adds extra features (like types) but ultimately needs to be converted into plain JavaScript to run in browsers and Node.js. This process is handled by the TypeScript Compiler (TSC), which does three things:

1️⃣ Type Checking – Ensures your code follows type rules but doesn’t include types in the final output.
2️⃣ Transpilation – Converts modern TypeScript (or ESNext) into an older JavaScript version (e.g., ES5, ES6).
3️⃣ Code Transformation – Strips TypeScript-specific features like interfaces and converts syntax based on the target setting.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝘀 𝗨𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗛𝗼𝗼𝗱?
1️⃣ Parsing & AST Creation – TypeScript parses the code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), breaking it into tokens (keywords, variables, operators, etc.).
2️⃣ Type Checking – The TypeScript compiler ensures type correctness but doesn’t include types in the final JavaScript output.
3️⃣ Code Emission – The compiler removes TypeScript-only features and converts modern JavaScript (e.g., optional chaining ?., nullish coalescing ??) into the specified ECMAScript version.

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗝𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁?
TypeScript provides several advantages:
✅ Static Typing – Prevents runtime errors by catching issues at compile time.
✅ Better IDE Support – Autocompletion, error checking, and refactoring tools.
✅ Improved Maintainability – Self-documenting code and better team collaboration.
✅ Scalability – Ideal for large applications where type safety prevents unexpected bugs.

𝗧𝘆𝗽𝗲𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗶𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 (𝘁𝘀𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗴.𝗷𝘀𝗼𝗻)
Want more control over how TypeScript compiles? The tsconfig.json file lets you configure:
📌 target – JavaScript version to compile to (ES5, ES6, ESNext).
📌 module – Module system (CommonJS, ESModules, etc.).
📌 strict – Enables strict type checking for safer code.
📌 outDir – Where compiled JavaScript files are saved.

𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗧𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀: 𝗧𝘆𝗽𝗲𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲𝘀 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁 𝗕𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿
TypeScript acts as a powerful safety net for JavaScript developers. While JavaScript is flexible, TypeScript prevents hidden bugs, improves developer experience, and makes large-scale applications easier to manage.

💬 What’s your experience with TypeScript’s compilation process?

It's 2025: Please stop using JavaScript and use TypeScript instead for the collective sanity of the world.

Without strong typing, programming is absolute chaos. It leads to incredibly gnarly bugs and code that is a mess to navigate.

There is no reason to have loosely typed languages. It's just a hacky way to get things working "sooner".

However, any velocity gains from loose typing will be immediately cancelled out from debugging all the fires it causes.

This is the classic bad engineer trade-off: Move faster so they can procrastinate (i.e. ignore) dealing with the crappiness of their code.

Two essential coding principles to significantly enhance your software quality:

🌀 DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Core Idea: Avoid duplicating code and logic across your project.
✅ Benefits:
Reduces code volume, simplifying maintenance
Minimizes errors (no need to duplicate fixes)
Enhances readability and reusability
📌 Example: Instead of replicating the authorization logic across different areas, encapsulate it in a separate method or service, and invoke it as needed.

🌀 KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
Core Idea: Aim for simplicity and avoid unnecessary complexity.
✅ Benefits:
Easier to maintain and modify
Simplifies error detection and correction
Reduces development and testing time
📌 Example: Rather than complicated, "clever" one-liners, write clear and understandable code that is easily readable and maintainable by other developers.

🔑 How to implement DRY and KISS?

Regularly refactor your code.
Always ask: "Can this be simplified or duplication avoided?"
Perform code reviews focusing on these principles.
Adhering to DRY and KISS principles significantly improves your code's quality, maintainability, and efficiency.

𝗨𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗥𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁: 𝗙𝗶𝗯𝗲𝗿, 𝗩𝗶𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗗𝗢𝗠, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 🚀

Rendering is a core concept in React, allowing it to efficiently update the UI while keeping performance smooth. To achieve this, React relies on Fiber, an advanced Virtual DOM algorithm designed for better scheduling and rendering optimization. Let’s break it down step by step.

🔹 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗼𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗩𝗶𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗗𝗢𝗠

In traditional web applications, updating the UI involves modifying the actual DOM (Document Object Model), which can be slow and inefficient. React solves this by using a Virtual DOM, a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM.

Instead of directly changing the DOM, React:

Creates a Virtual DOM tree that mirrors the UI.

Compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous version to detect changes.

Updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM, minimizing performance overhead.

🔹 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗙𝗶𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲

React Fiber is an internal engine introduced to enhance rendering performance. Unlike the older React reconciliation algorithm, which was synchronous and blocked the main thread, Fiber introduces incremental rendering and prioritization of updates.

With Fiber:

✅ Rendering work is split into smaller chunks, preventing UI freezes.

✅ Updates are prioritized based on urgency (e.g., user interactions are handled first).

✅ Background updates (like animations or data fetching) are handled more efficiently.

🔹 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸-𝗜𝗻-𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 (𝗪𝗜𝗣) 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗲 & 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

React maintains two versions of the UI tree:

Current Tree – Represents the UI as seen by the user.

Work-In-Progress (WIP) Tree – A temporary structure React builds to determine the next UI state.

During reconciliation, React:

Compares the WIP tree with the Current tree to identify changes.

Uses a diffing algorithm to determine which components need updating.

Efficiently patches the real DOM, rather than re-rendering everything.

🔹 Optimizing React Rendering

To make the most of React’s rendering process, consider:

✔️ Using useMemo and useCallback to avoid unnecessary re-computations.

✔️ Leveraging React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

✔️ Splitting components to minimize large re-renders.

✔️ Keeping state minimal and local where possible.

🚀 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗧𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀

React’s Fiber architecture, Virtual DOM, and efficient reconciliation process make it one of the most powerful UI libraries. Understanding how rendering works can help developers write more performant and scalable React applications.

Why React + Server Components Are the Future (and What You Need to Know)

The frontend world is shifting fast.
And one of the biggest shifts right now is React Server Components (RSCs).

Here’s the breakdown

- You send less JavaScript to the browser → faster pages.
- Your components can fetch their own data on the server → no more messy API calls in your frontend.
- Your app feels lighter, faster, and smarter, even when it’s complex.

Why does this matter?

1. Because users today won’t wait.
2. If your app is slow or clunky, they leave.
   Server Components help fix that and they let us build powerful apps without making the client heavy.

As a Senior Frontend Developer, I see this as a huge mindset shift:
It’s not just about building pages anymore.
It’s about deciding what belongs on the server and what stays on the client for the best experience. 🧠

⚡ If you’re working with React (especially Next.js 14+), this is something you’ll want to start learning now, not later.
👉 Have you tried Server Components yet? Would love to hear your experience!

Is Clean Architecture Overengineering? And Is Vibe Coding Undermining It?

In the fast-paced world of software development, Clean Architecture has long been held as a gold standard for building scalable, maintainable systems. Its principles, separating concerns, decoupling business logic, and enforcing dependency rules—are undeniably powerful. But lately, there's been a rising sentiment in some circles: Is Clean Architecture overengineering?
The truth is, it depends.

For large, complex systems that need to scale, support multiple teams, or survive long-term iterations, Clean Architecture is a life-saver. But for early stage startups, MVPs, or projects with a tight scope, the layered abstractions and rigid boundaries can slow things down. It’s not overengineering by definition—but applying it blindly without considering context often leads to exactly that.

And now enters vibe coding a culture driven more by aesthetics, quick wins, and developer “flow” than by thoughtful design. It thrives in the age of frameworks that "just work" and encourages minimal boilerplate, clever one-liners, and speed. While vibe coding can lead to rapid prototyping and joyful developer experiences, it can also subtly erode architecture discipline. Over time, small shortcuts compound, leaving teams with tangled dependencies, poor testability, and mounting tech debt.

So, is Clean Architecture dying? No!! but it’s being challenged. And perhaps that’s a good thing.

What we need isn't to abandon Clean Architecture or embrace vibe coding entirely. What we need is architectural pragmatism, choosing the right level of structure for the problem at hand, respecting long-term maintainability, while still empowering teams to move fast and ship things that work.
