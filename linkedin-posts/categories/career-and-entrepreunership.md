Entrepreneurs are obsessed with scale.

But scale has a problem.

- Scale often means more employees
- More employees mean more meetings
- More meetings mean more emails

And all of these things mean less time.

Here's the deal:

You don’t need a huge business to build a life you enjoy.

You need just enough.

- Enough customers.
- Enough time.
- Enough freedom.

Design a business around your ideal life.

Don't let your life be dictated by the endless chase for growth.

That's the opposite of the default path.

That's anti-scale.

My business doesn’t have a growth plan.

It has a life plan.

That means staying intentionally small.

By choice.

No hustle culture, no big teams, no endless meetings.

Just focus, simplicity, and plenty of space to breathe.

My definition of minimalism isn’t about owning fewer things.

It’s about fewer obligations, fewer headaches, fewer hours chained to my desk.

When you unsubscribe from the pressure to scale, you create room to build something meaningful.

A life you actually enjoy living.

Think small.
Live big.

The world has changed.

You don't need permission anymore.

No gatekeepers to say you're "qualified."
No barriers blocking your path.
No corporate ladder to slowly climb.

The internet has democratized opportunity.

Want to start a business? Do it.
Want to build an audience? Start today.
Want to change careers? Go for it.

The tools are there.
The knowledge is available.
The market is waiting.

Stop asking for permission.
Stop waiting for the "right time."
Stop letting others define your path.

Just start building.

Your boss impacts your health more than your doctor.

Brutal truth:
↳ It makes or breaks your quality of life.

🔴 Don't settle for bad bosses.
🟢 Look for good managers who:

1/ Want to see you succeed
↳ They should be in your corner, not on your shoulders

2/ Give you opportunities to grow
↳ You either grow or stagnate. There is no in-between

3/ Encourage you to take care of your health
↳ The healthier you, the better the work you do

4/ Let you leave work at work
↳ Unless you're on call, you should be able to relax

5/ Listen to you (actually listen)
↳ Just a genuine, human connection

Are you a manager?
Be the boss you'd want to have.

What's THE best thing a manager did for you?

You're told success comes from hacks and hustle.

They're so wrong 🤯

They just want to sell you hacks and hustles.

↳ 24h session doesn't fix 6 months of missed workouts.
↳ Books are not written in one sitting (I should know).
↳ 2 weeks of diet won't fix years of bad habits.

🔴 You don't need to be more motivated.
🟢 You need to be more consistent.

30 seconds to triple your discipline TODAY:

1/ Figure out your GOALS
↳ Make them concrete & realistic
↳ "Do 7 pull-ups", not "get in shape"

2/ Design ROUTINE
↳ Remove motivation from the equation
↳ Put yourself in a situation when YES is the default

3/ TRACK your progress
↳ Stay motivated & on the right track
↳ Don't overthink it, paralysis by analysis is real

That's it.
No fancy stuff.
Get the basics right.
The future you will be proud 🙌

Everyone needs to hear this...

The real reason to do hard things:

Here's the truth: We don’t value what’s easy. We value what we earn.

The more effort we put in, the more meaning we extract. The struggle is important because it provides a texture to our lives.

We ascribe value and meaning to the things we work hard for:
• The business built from the ground up
• The promotion earned after years of focus
• The deep relationship shaped through shared struggle
• The healthy body carved through challenging workouts
• The peaceful mind forged through solitude

The effort required to earn these things increases their value.

Your entire life will change the moment you realize it’s not supposed to be easy. The most valuable things in life are hard to earn. That’s precisely why they’re so valuable.

So, why do hard things?

Because nothing feels better than a hard-earned win. Nothing. The pain. The struggle. The resilience. The grit. And then, the reward. The thrill of knowing that you paid the cost of entry for the thing you wanted to achieve.

Hard things are good for the soul.

Fear of making mistakes will kill your career.

Here's the subtle truth:

👉 all successful people make awful mistakes
👉 you just don't see them

People try to avoid mistakes:
↳ Pretending to know everything
↳ Hiding in their comfort zone

🔴 It doesn't work
🟢 Here's what to do instead:

0/ Reframe
↳ "I'm not qualified" -> "I'm learning"

1/ Is the decision reversible?
↳ If so, don't sweat - you can go back and change

2/ Seek discomfort
↳ Take on challenges that are feasible, but stretch you\*

3/ Acknowledge what you don't know
↳ Say "I don't know" to build your credibility

🎯 Remember:
Stan Lee was nearly 40 before he saw any success.
Marvel movies have grossed over $22 billion worldwide.

What mistake ended up not as bad as you thought?

Resolve a real problem

Until you gain your first commercial experience, come up with a project that provides a positive answer to the following question: does the project solve a real-world problem or not? For example, create a business card website for a friend who does nails, or a Telegram bot to automate the workflow for a buddy.

When the task is connected to the real world, it’s easier to learn the code that solves the problem, and its structures are easier to remember.

Is your SaaS still hosted on localhost:3000?

❌ Stop building

A scrappy product in production is always better than a perfect product on your local machine...
